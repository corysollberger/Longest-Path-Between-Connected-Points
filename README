README COS350 HOMEWORK 4

The program takes an input of values which denote the starting location and "slides" that allow a character to move
between islands. The algorithm produces a pathway that calculates the longest path that starts and ends at the starting
location. 

The program should work to specifications

I tested my input with
	1 2 2 3 1 3 2 4 5 4 3 1
	
	Resulting in the correct output:
	
	3
	1
	2
	3
	1
	
The input needs to be whitespace delimited but will accept any key value that is a string, also there
needs to be an even number of whitespace delimited values.
